After all, are you even an <a href=https://github.com/jeremyckahn/>open source developer</a> if you don&rsquo;t make the occasional rambling screed on the internet?</p><p>The first time I tried this, I used <a href=http://octopress.org/>Octopress</a>. I really enjoyed the Git and Markdown-driven nature of the tool, but sadly it has become irrelevant due to lack of maintenance. Also nobody uses Ruby anymore <sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>. The second time I tried this, I used Medium. But Medium doesn&rsquo;t support syntax highlighting without <a href=https://medium.com/@Maluen0/how-to-add-code-highlighting-in-medium-articles-without-leaving-the-editor-8f24f5a88d28>absurd workarounds</a>, so I gave up on it. Next I tried <a href=https://dev.to/jeremyckahn>dev.to</a>. I like dev.to and actually plan to keep using it for some content because it provides a lot of nice features out of the box and has a strong community. But I&rsquo;ve come to realize that dev.to is more geared towards tutorials, which is not always what I want to write. Sometimes I just want to rant into the void about computers and dev.to simply isn&rsquo;t the forum for that. Also I don&rsquo;t love the idea of my authored content generating income for a platform that doesn&rsquo;t share it back with me.</p><p>If I&rsquo;m not making money with my work, then nobody is, dammit.</p><p>Which brings me to this iteration of my attempt at blogging. This blog is <a href=https://github.com/jeremyckahn/jeremyckahn.github.io>open source</a> and built with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. I wanted a solution that would get the tech out of the way and just let me write. I&rsquo;m hoping that Hugo can be that. <a href=https://github.com/jeremyckahn/jeremyckahn.github.io/commit/f1d83c7edc4a7eb4c9cca289240f7a350b8968fb>I&rsquo;ve set this blog up</a> such that I can just <a href=https://github.com/jeremyckahn/jeremyckahn.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/init-post.yml>create a post and go</a>. Hopefully by simplifying the blogging process down to just managing Markdown files and <a href=https://github.com/jeremyckahn/jeremyckahn.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml>pushing to GitHub</a>, I can stay motivated to actually write. We shall see.</p><p>I like to make snarky jokes about technology. I like absurdity. I don&rsquo;t take anything seriously, because life is too short for that. I believe in <a href=https://twitter.com/mjkeenan/status/832684374680219649>Comedy first. Always</a>. If you can&rsquo;t learn to laugh at yourself and everything else, this blog is probably not for you. There&rsquo;s also an outside chance that I may occasionally have something vaguely insightful to share, but I&rsquo;m not making any promises.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>I am not actually this self-congratulatory.
